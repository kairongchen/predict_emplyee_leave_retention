Employee Retention Prediction

This is my second machine learning project for predicting whether an employee if likely to leave. The entire project is splited into four steps: exploratory analysis, data preparation, model training, and delivery project as Python Class. I trained several classification models including Logistic Regressions, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree. 

The project is part of the professional training program in Elite Data Science Academy.
